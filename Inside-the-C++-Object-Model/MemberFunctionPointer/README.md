#   Member Function Pointer(MFP)
This demo demonstrates that the member function pointer.<br/>
Show that the MFP can correctly point a virtual function in a virtual hierarchy.<br/>
A Member Function will get an offset value of the function if the function is virtual.<br/>
Then it will indicate an address value in the program memory of the function when the member function is non-virtual.
