#   Inheritance Traits
This demo is demonstrating the virtual attribute will be lost in the inheritance when
a direct subclass override the virtual function without virtual key word.<br/>
The result is the virtual attribute will not lost even if the direct sub-class not declare the virtual
attribute and the virtual attribute of function will appear in sub-subclasses.
