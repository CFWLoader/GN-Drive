memory3.c is an experiment that keeping requiring more memory until system kill it.<br/>
So it's unnecessary to run it.<br/>

Note that the programs are simple that just require memories but do not release it.<br/>

There are some other memory management such as NULL pointer test and release memory.<br/>
But I'm familiar with them, so I didn't copy this codes.
